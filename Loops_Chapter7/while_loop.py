#2. while loop : Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True. You donâ€™t always know how many times it will run.
# In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop is executed otherwise not! If the loop is entered, the process [condition check & execution] is continued until the condition becomes False.
