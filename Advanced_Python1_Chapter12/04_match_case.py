'''MATCH CASE
--------------
Python 3.10 introduced the match statement, which is similar to the switch statement found in other programming languages.
The basic syntax of the match statement involves matching a variable against several cases using the case keyword.'''


def http_status(status):
    match status:
        case 200:
            return "OK"
        case 404:
            return "Not Found"
        case 500:
            return "Internal Server Error"
        case _: # its called default
            return "Unknown status"
# Usage
print(http_status(200)) # Output: OK
print(http_status(404)) # Output: Not Found
print(http_status(500)) # Output: Internal Server Error
print(http_status(403)) # Output: Unknown status
