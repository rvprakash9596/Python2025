# Recursion is a function which calls itself.It is used to directly use a mathematical formula as function.

# Factorial is the precise example of Recursion

'''
factorial(0)= 1
factorial(1)= 1
factorial(2)= 2 X 1
factorial(3)= 3 X 2 X 1
factorial(4)= 4 X 3 X 2 X 1
factorial(5)= 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1

factorial(n)= n X n-1 X n-2 X .......3 X 2 X 1

factorial(n)= n* factorial(n-1)
'''

def fact(n):
    if(n==0 or n==1):
        return 1
    return n * fact(n-1)
n=int(input("Enter Number : "))
print(f"The factorial of {n} = {fact(n)}")

print(fact(5))
print(fact(6))
print(fact(7))
print(fact(0))
print(fact(1))

The programmer needs to be extremely careful while working with recursion to ensure
that the function doesnâ€™t infinitely keep calling itself. Recursion is sometimes the most
direct way to code an algorithm.
