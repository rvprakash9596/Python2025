#The random-access memory is volatile, and all its contents are lost once a program terminates. In order to persist the data forever, we use files. A file is data stored in a storage device. A python program can talk to the file by reading content from it and writing content to it.

# the word "persist" means to save or store something permanently — so that it doesn't get lost when the program ends or the computer shuts down.


# TYPE OF FILES.
# There are 2 types of files:
# 1. Text files (.txt, .c, etc)
# 2. Binary files (.jpg, .dat, etc)
# Python has a lot of functions for reading, updating, and deleting files.


OPENING A FILE
Python has an open() function for opening files. It takes 2 parameters: filename and mode.

# open("filename", "mode of opening(read mode by default)")
open("this.txt", "r")

READING A FILE IN PYTHON
# Open the file in read mode
f = open("this.txt", "r")
# Read its contents
text = f.read()
# Print its contents
print(text)
36
# Close the file
f.close()

OTHER METHODS TO READ THE FILE.
We can also use f.readline() function to read one full line at a time.

f.readlines()

MODES OF OPENING A FILE
r – open for reading
w - open for writing
a - open for appending
+ - open for updating.
‘rb’ will open for read in binary mode.
‘rt’ will open for read in text mode.
