# Loops :A loop in programming is a control structure that repeats a block of code multiple times based on a condition.

# 3 Types of loop in Python : In Python, there are two main types of loops:
#1. for loop : Used to iterate over a sequence (like list, tuple, string, or range). You know in advance how many times it will run.

#2. while loop : Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True. You donâ€™t always know how many times it will run.
