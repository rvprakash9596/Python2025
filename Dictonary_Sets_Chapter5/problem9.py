# 9. Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S? s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}


s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}
print(s)

# ans= pahli baat to hm list ko set k andar include hi nhi kr sakte
# Because sets can only contain immutable (hashable) elements. aur agar kr bhi rhe ho to is prakar se krna hai s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", (1,2)}
